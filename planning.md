# Planning

## General
- Make screen auto-focus on first element displayed below btns when btn clicked inside building
- Dropdown should not have anything selected by default, display div content should ask user to select option before continuing, add randomize btn that accesses entire db
- Figure out why building interior bkgd isn't fixed on mobile (not issue with screen size, specific to device?)
- Put HTML building pages in their own folder while still being able to access folders/files outside
- Dark mode, enable manually or detect system
- Rearrange buildings into more map-like random-like layout
- Add shadow to buildings when hovering over them
- Improve map background
- Hand-drawn digital illustrations
- Style/arrange elements/features of building pages to look more like actual interior of building
