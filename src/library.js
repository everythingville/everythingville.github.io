                title: "Don Juan",
                blurb: "by Lord Byron is a satirical epic poem written in the early 19th century. The poem follows the misadventures of its titular character, Don Juan, a young man who is not portrayed as a seducer, but rather as one who is easily seduced by women. Through various encounters and a humorous lens, Byron explores themes of love, societal norms, and human folly. The opening of \"Don Juan\" sets a lively and witty tone, starting with an ironic dedication to poet Robert Southey, which critiques contemporary poets and celebrates poetic freedom. We are introduced to the protagonist, Don Juan, who is born in Seville to a noble father and a highly educated mother, Donna Inez, who has aspirations of making him a paragon of virtue. However, the narrative quickly hints at the complications of their relationships, particularly as Juan's innocence leads him into the clutches of love and seduction, contrasting sharply with the societal expectations imposed upon him. The conflict escalates when Juan inadvertently becomes involved in a scandal with Donna Julia, leading to a comedic yet profound examination of moral hypocrisy and desire.",
